The following is a definition of:  MAJOR SECTOR PRODUCTIVITY AND COSTS (PR) 

Survey Description:  Productivity and costs measures are published for six
major sectors:  Business, nonfarm business, nonfinancial corporations,
total manufacturing, durable goods manufacturing, and nondurable goods
manufacturing.

For each sector, measures of industry analytic ratios (e.g., productivity,
unit labor costs) are available as well as basic data (e.g., output, hours,
and compensation) on which they are based. Output data are from the Bureau
of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau of the U.S. Department of
Commerce; the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor; and the
Federal Reserve Board.  Compensation data are from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Employment and average weekly
hours are selected from the BLS establishment survey, and, where necessary
for the farm sector and for the self-employed, from the BLS labor force
survey.  The labor input measure is then converted to the hours at work
concept using results of a special annual survey, conducted for this
purpose.

Summary Data Available:  There are approximately 282 Major Sector
Productivity series available on the LABSTAT database.  Series for business
and nonfarm business begin in 1947, those for manufacturing in 1987, and
those for nonfinancial corporations in 1958.

Frequency of Observations:  Series are available quarterly and annually.
Quarterly measures are based entirely on seasonally adjusted data.

Annual Averages:  For some manufacturing series, only annual averages are
available.

Base Periods:  The base period for the indexes presented for each series is
2005 = 100.

Data Characteristics:  All percent changes are calculated using index numbers
rounded to three decimal places.  Indexes are stored to three decimal places 
and percent changes are stored to one decimal place.

Update Schedule:  Updates are performed near the beginning of the second and 
third month of each quarter, reflecting new data from the preceding quarter.
Traditionally, all revisions to source data are reflected in the following release.

Section 3
=================================================================================
The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time
over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define 
pr.series.  Note that the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist 
in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated 
by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the data
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

Field #/Data Element    Length          Value(Example)          

1.  series_id           17              PRS30006011

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define
each data file.  Note that the field numbers are for reference only; they do not 
exist in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are 
separated by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for 
the data elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character.

The pr.data file is partitioned into two separate files:

        1.  pr.data.0.Current   - All current year-to-date data
        2.  pr.data.1.AllData   - All data
